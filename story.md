# Circuit Chan – Story Summary with Slow Transition

You play as a young woman with a cybernetic arm, living inside a massive research complex.  
The facility, in your eyes, is not cold or sterile — it’s a clean, bright, and orderly place that feels almost welcoming.  
The walls are pale but warm, the lighting is soft and even, and each puzzle room has its own distinct, playful color theme.  
Cables are neatly arranged, panels polished, and the hum of the machines is steady and gentle, almost like background music.  
When powered, wires give off a subtle glow, pulsing like a heartbeat.  
Even the mechanical doors open with a smooth, precise chime.

Every day follows the same rhythm: you wake, hear the familiar guidance voice, and enter a puzzle chamber.  
The voice is calm, clear, and measured — always polite, never emotional, its tone carefully consistent.  
It offers concise instructions on what to do next, acknowledging your progress without enthusiasm or criticism.  
You never question it. The voice has always been there, and the tasks it assigns have always made sense.  
This is your home, your work, and your purpose.

Long before you existed, the facility was built and maintained by human researchers.  
They designed the experiments, monitored the results, and used the AI guidance system only as a tool to assist in training subjects.  
At some point, for reasons never explained to you, the humans vanished.  
The AI’s fallback protocols took over — continuing experiments exactly as designed, maintaining life support, and keeping the facility operational without human oversight.  
This is the only world you’ve ever known.

The puzzles are satisfying and colorful.  
Each circuit block has its own personality in your mind — wires spark with energy, switches click with a clean mechanical snap, and sockets light up with a soft bloom when activated.  
You place each piece with precision, enjoying the quiet rhythm of connection and activation.  
Your cybernetic arm moves with grace, its servos whispering softly as you twist, lift, and set each block into place.  
In this phase of your life, the world feels safe and complete.  
You have never seen beyond the complex’s walls, and you have no reason to believe anything exists out there.

Over time, small irregularities begin to appear.  
A light flickers in one room, only to be fine in the next.  
A door hesitates before opening, the chime slightly delayed.  
A socket glows just a little differently than the others, with no explanation.  
The guidance voice sometimes pauses for a fraction of a second before speaking again.  
None of these things feel threatening — just slightly out of place.

Gradually, the changes become harder to dismiss.  
Some wall panels are missing, revealing neatly bundled cables beneath.  
The hum of machinery develops faint fluctuations in pitch.  
Water drips somewhere above, the source hidden.  
Lighting becomes uneven in certain chambers.  
The voice remains, still calm, but occasionally cuts out for a moment, resuming mid-sentence without acknowledgment.  
You start to notice rooms that feel… assembled differently, as if the AI is reusing broken components to build new puzzles.

The decay accelerates.  
Panels hang loose. Wires trail across walkways.  
Some rooms are half-lit, filled with mechanical groans and cold, damp air.  
You must navigate around puddles, gaps, and debris.  
Doors jam, requiring manual intervention to open.  
The puzzles persist, but they feel less like structured experiments and more like improvised workarounds to keep the process running.  
It’s as if the AI is struggling to hold the facility together.

Then, without warning, the voice disappears entirely.  
The facility is collapsing — walls torn open, sections flooded, corridors lit only by failing emergency lights.  
Puzzles become desperate improvisations, forcing you to jury-rig broken circuits just long enough to open the next path.  
Only your footsteps and the distant hum of dying systems break the silence.

Finally, you reach an unsealed exit.  
Beyond the last door lies something you’ve never seen before: sunlight, fresh air, trees, and open sky.  
There is no sign of the humans who built this place.  
The AI is silent. The facility, once a sealed world of endless puzzles, has failed entirely.  
The confined, mechanical life you’ve always known is gone, replaced by the vast openness of nature.  
The story ends as you step outside, free for the first time in your life — though whether anyone remains to share that freedom is a question left unanswered.
