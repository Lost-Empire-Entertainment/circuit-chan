# Circuit game

This is a challenge for myself to make a game with KalaWindow. The goal is to make a 1-layer circuit simulator game in "free mode" aka no quests, no goals, just make any kind of a circuit with the given parts. I don't have any electrical engineering background so the logic may be broken or invalid in real world use cases so take this game as a fun hobby project and not a real world simulation.

This project also used [KalaTestProject](https://github.com/KalaKit/KalaTestProject) as the foundation and built upon it.
