> Due to ongoing rewriting of this project Linux support is not functional. It will be added back before the rewrite is complete once this announcement section is removed.

This is a C++ executable for Windows and Linux (x11 only, wayland not supported) showcasing an example of KalaWindow in an end-user scenario with both OpenGL 3.3 and Vulkan 1.2. KalaCrashHandler has also been added for handy crash reports.
